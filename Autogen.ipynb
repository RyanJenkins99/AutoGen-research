      "Following the meeting, I will create a list of action items based on the discussion with the Human_Decision_Maker. These may include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Scheduling regular optimization checks (e.g., every 3-6 months)\n",
      "* Implementing changes to resource utilization and management\n",
      "* Identifying new opportunities for cost savings\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "After the meeting, I will follow up with the Human_Decision_Maker to confirm any action items and provide updates on their implementation.\n",
