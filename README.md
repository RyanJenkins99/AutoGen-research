For My AI Goal I used Gemini to help me do some research and form an opinion on the Agentic Framework Autogen. I decided to do a real world use case to validate its usefulness. The use case I decided to do was creating a team of agents to minimize cluster resources and monitor how much money we’re spending in running our deployments and if say someone forgets to wipe down workloads have an agent in place that will monitor this and complete the appropriate fix while keeping the human engineer in the loop.
